##  Security Practices

### Data Protection
- **No data collection**: All sentiment analysis occurs locally in your browser
- **No tracking**: Zero analytics or user behavior monitoring
- **Storage**: Uses Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` with encryption for settings

### Code Safety
- **Dependencies**: Regularly audited via `npm audit`
- **Permissions**: Minimal Chrome API access:
  ```json
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "activeTab",
    "https://*.twitter.com/*"
  ]
  ```
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  ```json
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
  }
  ```

### Review Process
- All pull requests require:
  - Security review by maintainers
  - Static analysis using [ESLint Security Rules](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security)
  - Manual inspection for:
    - XSS vulnerabilities
    - Injection risks
    - Permission escalations
